<div class="mydiv"><h2  style="color: black;">Image processing with python</h2>
<p> Hello Everyone , i am vignesh ,this is my blog about Image Processing with python <br> This was originally made in jupyter notebook in July 13 , 2020 in my <a style="color: blue;" href="https://github.com/vignesh14052002/image-processing-series/blob/master/image%20manipulation%20(1).ipynb">github repository</a> for my instagram page <a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.instagram.com/_._hello_world._._/?hl=en">helloworld</a></p>
<p>In this blog i am going to discuss about Image Processing with python</p>
<p>There are many modules for image processing in python like opencv , pillow etc . If you want to master any of these modules you can refer their documentation . <br> The purpose of this blog is to teach image processing without using any modules so that you can get a cleaner understanding ( i will only use PIL to load and save images)</p>
<p>below is the set of codes written in jupyter notebook , these were available in my github repository mentioned above </p>
